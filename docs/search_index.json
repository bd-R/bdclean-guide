["index.html", "bdDwC User Guide Introduction", " bdDwC User Guide Authors: TBA 2018-09-03 Introduction bdDwC is an R package that supplies a Shiny app and a set of functions for standardizing field names according to the Darwin Core (DwC) format. bdDwC is a key element in the bdverse– a collection of tools, that form a general framework for facilitating biodiversity science in R. bdDwC in the bdverse What is the Darwin Core standard? Darwin Core (DwC) is a global standard for publishing biodiversity data, whose goal is to facilitate the sharing of biodiversity information, by providing identifiers, labels, and definitions (D. A. G. Wieczorek John AND Bloom 2012). DwC was established as an evolving community-developed standard, by the Biodiversity Information Standards Working Group (www.tdwg.org). DwC is a library of definitions of common biodiversity data terms, each of which represents a field within the database. There are around 200 such fields (not including DwC extensions); a full set of the DwC terms with their descriptions is available in the Quick Reference Guide (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms). For more information see section 6. Why it’s important to “Darwinize” a dataset Running the Darwinizer enables you to standardize many field names in your dataset – and that allows the bdverse to handle data from various biodiversity portals, and lets you enjoy all of bdvers features, regardless of publishers variation in field names.

Local file size cannot exceed 1GB [?] [ Need To Be Updated! ] Data upload from a local file 2.3.2 From an online database Also, data can be retrieved directly from various online biodiversity databases. You need only to: Select the database Specify the desired scientific name. Specify the number of records (upper limit of 50,000). Check the box if records must have coordinates. Wait for data to be downloaded. [ Need To Be Updated! ] Data upload from online biodiversity databases 2.4 Dictionaries A dictionary is a key component when Darwinizing a dataset. It’s basically a lookup table that lists a possible variation of field name and it corresponding DwC name. 2.4.1 The Darwin Cloud dictionary The Darwin Cloud dictionary (J. Wieczorek et al. 2017), is a lookup table that accumulates different variations in DwC field names from different publishers. This valuable and critical dictionary was created and is maintained by the Kurator project (http://kurator.acis.ufl.edu/kurator-web/), which provides workflow tools for data quality improvement of biodiversity data, via a user-friendly web interface. The development of bdDwC was inspired by Kurator’s own Darwinizer. Updating the Darwin Cloud It’s recommended to update the Darwin Cloud file. This can be done easily by clicking the Update DC button. [ Need To Be Updated! ] Updating the Darwin Cloud 2.4.2 Your own dictionary It’s also possible to add your own dictionary by simply creating a CSV file with two columns, one for the Field Names and one for the Standard Names. [ Need To Be Updated! ] Uploading your own dictionary 2.5 Darwinizing your dataset Once a dataset is uploaded, the ‘Submit to Darwinizer’ button is activated, Clicking it will Darwinize the dataset. [ Need To Be Updated! ] Submit to Darwinizer button 2.6 Darwinizer results 2.6.1 Results page overwiew [ Need To Be Updated! ] Darwinizer results Manually renaming field names can be done very easily, just choose the two corresponding fields and click the Rename button. [ Need To Be Updated! ] Manually renaming fields Hovering over a DwC standard name will display its description. 2.7 Download your Darwinized data [ Need To Be Updated! ] 2.8 Closing the app Just close the app browser tab, and the R session will be terminated.
