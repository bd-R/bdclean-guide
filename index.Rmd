# Introduction {-}

`bdDwC` is an R package that supplies a Shiny app and a set of functions for standardizing field names according to the Darwin Core (DwC) format. `bdDwC` is a key element in the `bdverse`-- a collection of tools, that form a general framework for facilitating biodiversity science in R.

#### What is the Darwin Core standard? {-}

Darwin Core (DwC) is a global standard for publishing biodiversity data, whose goal is to facilitate the sharing of biodiversity information, by providing identifiers, labels, and definitions [@DwC-paper]. DwC was established as an evolving community-developed standard, by the Biodiversity Information Standards Working Group (www.tdwg.org). DwC is a library of definitions of common biodiversity data terms, each of which represents a field within the database. There are around 200 such fields (not including DwC extensions); a full set of the DwC terms with their descriptions is available in the Quick Reference Guide (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms). For more information see section [6][Learn more about Darwin Core].

#### Why it's important to "Darwinize" a dataset {-}

Running the Darwinizer enables you to standardize many field names in your dataset -- and that allows the `bdverse` to handle data from various biodiversity portals, and lets you enjoy all of `bdvers` features, regardless of publishers variation in field names.
